# Abstract

Precision neuroimaging aims to deliver individualized assessments of brain health, yet a single structural MRI does not provide a scalable, multidimensional, quantitative summary of an individual’s current or future health. Existing approaches optimize task-specific objectives, yielding representations entangled with cohort- or disease-specific signals rather than capturing biologically grounded anatomical patterns.Here, we introduce NeuroFM, a foundation model trained exclusively on 100,000 healthy synthetic volumes to predict morphometric and demographic targets. Without exposure to disease-labelled data, NeuroFM organizes brain structure into population-level patterns encoding brain health differences. These representations transfer across neuroscience domains without adaptation and support simple linear readouts for clinical, cognitive, developmental, socio-behavioural, and image quality. Evaluated on 136,361 multi-cohort volumes, NeuroFM generalizes across domains and enables individual-level brain health profiling, estimating future dementia risk years before diagnosis. Together, these findings establish a disease-naïve foundation model for precision neuroimaging with potential to support quantitative brain health assessments across settings. Code, model, and demo are available on the [project website](https://rocknroll87q.github.io/NeuroFM/).

<figcaption>Figure 1 | General overview. a, Foundation model (NeuroFM) pre-trained on 100,000 AI-generated volumes (left) using supervised learning targets for age, total brain volume (TBV), ventricular volume, and sex (middle). NeuroFM acts in two modes: predictor which gives four brain health estimates (age, sex, TBV, and ventricular volume), and encoder which extracts 100+ brain health features from each MRI. In this work, we apply NeuroFM to a variety of tasks, including classification, regression, and qualitative clustering analysis (right). b, After pre-training, the model is applied across five biologically motivated task subgroups: clinical, cognitive, socio-behavioural, developmental, and image quality metrics (left to right). c, By combining subtasks at inference (left), NeuroFM can create comprehensive, individualized health reports for a single individual (middle), with explainable attribution maps to highlight relevant brain regions (right).</figcaption>

Existing approaches optimize task-specific objectives, yielding representations entangled with cohort- or disease-specific signals rather than capturing biologically grounded patterns of anatomical variation. Here, we introduce NeuroFM, a foundation model trained exclusively on 100,000 healthy synthetic volumes to predict morphometric and demographic targets. Without exposure to diagnostic labels, NeuroFM organizes brain MRIs into population-level patterns that encode meaningful brain health differences. These representations transfer across five neuroscience domains without adaptation and support simple linear readouts for clinical, cognitive, developmental, socio-behavioural, and image quality control. Evaluated on 136,361 real volumes spanning multiple cohorts, NeuroFM generalizes across domains and enables individual-level brain health profiling, estimating future dementia risk years before diagnosis. Together, these findings establish a disease-naive foundation model paradigm for precision neuroimaging. Code available at: https://rocknroll87q.github.io/NeuroFM/},
